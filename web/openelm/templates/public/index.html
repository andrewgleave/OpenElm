        <h2>Welcome to the Open Elm Project</h2>
        <h5 class="intro a">The Open Elm Project is a collaboration between <a href="http://www.redrobotstudios.com/">Red Robot Studios</a> and <a href="http://www.gov.im/daff/trees_and_plants/trees/elm/">Isle of Man Department of Environment, Food and Agriculture</a> to create a detailed, public-powered record of the Islands's elm trees to help monitor and control Dutch Elm Disease.</h5>
        <p>You don’t have to be a expert to take part &ndash; just follow the simple tips on <a href="{% url public_identify %}">how to identify</a> an elm tree, and you can help make a huge difference to save our Island’s elm&nbsp;population.</p>
        <p>Between 1968 and 1988 England lost <strong class="hl_g">75%</strong> of its elms, and even though Dutch Elm Disease has reached the Isle of Man, effective control has meant that we have lost less than 1% of our elms. However, we need your help to ensure it stays under control.</p>
        <h4>What you can do to help:</h4>
        <ol class="leaf_markers">
            <li>Learn how to spot an elm <em>(see <a href="{% url public_identify %}">our identification tips</a>)</em></li>
            <li>Use the app or the <a href="{% url public_submit_report %}">report form</a> record any elms you see</li>
            <li>If you think an elm is infected, report it as quickly as possible</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Your reports can really help stop Dutch Elm disease spreading on our beautiful Island.</p>
